# Reverse Engineering MechWarrior 3

An unofficial project to reverse engineer (RE) the 1998 game MechWarrior 3. The aim is to be able to extract most MechWarrior 3 assets to modern, well-documented, and usable formats.

This repository has [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) which journals my RE attempts and findings. There is a companion project, [MechWarrior 3 Asset Extractor](https://github.com/tobywf/mech3ax), with functional code needed to extract assets to modern formats. But if you're interested in the details or how it was done, this is for you.
