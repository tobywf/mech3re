    "And [enhanced audio CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_CD) usually means there is data and audio on the same disk. In fact there are two ambient/background tracks, roughly three minutes earch. Using [ExactAudioCopy](http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/) (EAC)\\*, I ripped the tracks from US versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2, as well as German version 1.0 as Waveform Audio files (`*.wav`). This was mainly to make comparisons easier, but that didn't work out, as we will see. So I'd recommend compressing them using a lossy format like [AAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding) - a bitrate of 128 kilobytes should be plenty for ambient tracks. This produces file sizes around 3 MiB, so 10% of the original. (Lossless compression like [FLAC](https://xiph.org/flac/) produces ~40%.)\n",
