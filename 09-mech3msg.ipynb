    "The German version predictably has the language `LANG_GERMAN`. This isn't an uncommon way of handling localisation. In fact Microsoft describes a similar approach to [\"localizing message strings\"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wes/localizing-message-strings). With some help from structures in `Winnt.h` - [MESSAGE_RESOURCE_DATA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-message_resource_data), [MESSAGE_RESOURCE_BLOCK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-message_resource_block), and [MESSAGE_RESOURCE_ENTRY](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-message_resource_entry) - it's trivial to read the message table on all platforms, without Windows APIs (I believe internally the executable uses `FormatMessage`).\n",

In Python - but only on Windows - this can be done as follows:"

    "The messages can be extracted in a hacky way (they are padded to 4 bytes with zeros which helps). Luckily, there is also a table in the `.data` section that encoded the message name address, and the message table ID (in reversed order). This is pretty reliable, although detecting the end of the table is a bit janky. There is an unknown value. For zeroed out entries, it's 0. For all others, it seems to be 4096.\n",

    "All of this is to say it's now possible to extract the message names and values. This code isn't very interesting as part of the write-up, as it's largely parsing the portable executable (PE) format and implementing functionality to read Windows message tables. \n",

    "1. Not all messages have corresponding values in the message table - it was probably easier to leave them in, knowing they're unused than recreate this data.\n",
